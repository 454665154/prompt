{"name":"Simple Prompt","tagline":"Simple Node.js commandline prompt","body":"> Simple Node.js commandline prompt\r\n\r\nWhile working on a Node.js automation tool I needed to generate some files and code after gathering a few details from the user. Most of the modules that I found were a bit of an over-kill, all I wanted was a good old prompt (the browser type) so I decided to write this module. \r\n\r\n### Installation\r\n\r\n````\r\nnpm install simple-prompt \r\n````\r\n\r\n### How to use\r\n\r\nSimple prompt accepts an array of `question objects`\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nvar prompt = require('simple-prompt');\r\n\r\nvar questions = [\r\n    {\r\n        question: 'Name',\r\n        \r\n        required: true // required\r\n        \r\n        default: 'John' // default value\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n        question: 'Surname' //optional\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n        question: 'Age',\r\n        \r\n        required: true, // required\r\n        \r\n        validate: function (answer) {\r\n            return parseInt(answer, 10) >= 18; // only 18 or higher\r\n        },\r\n        \r\n        filter: function (answer) {\r\n            return parseInt(answer, 10); // bring back my answer as a number\r\n        },\r\n        \r\n        default: 18 // default value\r\n    }\r\n];\r\n\r\nprompt(questions, function (answers) {\r\n    console.log(answers);\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Questin object\r\nThe `question object` has 4 properties that you can specify:\r\n\r\n - question (String)- label for your question and key for your answer.\r\n - default (String)- default value if answer is not given.\r\n - required (Boolean) - flag to indicated if input is required.\r\n - validate (Function) - a function that accepts a string and returns a boolean value after testing it.\r\n - filter (Function) - a function that accepts a string and returns it after doing operations on it.\r\n \r\n \r\n### Testing\r\n```\r\nnpm test\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\n(MIT License)\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2013 Qawelesizwe Mlilo <qawemlilo@gmail.com>\r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the 'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\r\n\r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED 'AS IS', WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
